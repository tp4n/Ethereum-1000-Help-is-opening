# Ethereum-1000-Help-is-opening
Good day. In 2016, I was collecting ether on my graphics cards as soon as it appeared in the pools. Created a wallet on Ethereum wallet. Put the wallet and geth. Everything worked fine and without interruptions. I logged in and displayed my ether several times, but once something incomprehensible happened and some kind of glitch happened when I updated geth c 0.6.9 to a newer version. After that, the password from the wallet stopped working. Who can help or suggest how to get access? I tried many options, both by brute force and by brute force and brute force password (I thought I forgot). I assume that there was some kind of system bug and now mined ethers are lost forever 1000 + Eth.Here is the address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b915dd5e86547dd2b6eda587ac4a2319fe92b4 The password consists of 12 numbers and letters (Small and Large). There are no special characters. Need help from developers and programmers who can help.
